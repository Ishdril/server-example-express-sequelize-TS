## Greetings

This repo is meant to be a mock implementation that demonstrates how to use TypeScript on an express server with Sequelize.

This has been a popular choice of technologies amonst my students and typing Sequelize has proved a bit of a challenge in some situations. I hope this repo acts as a guide for them and other programmers.

This implementation is far from perfect, but I'm willing to work on it and make it more robust in time. Feel free to contribute to it by making a pull request or rising an issue if you think that some changes must be made.

Also, don't forget to star the project and fork it if it was useful to you.

## Getting Started

You can fork the project and clone it locally to see how it works.
Follow these steps to set it up:

1. Fork the project and clone it in your system
2. run `$ npm install` to install all the necessary dependencies
3. setup an SQL database of your choice. I have used PostgresQL for this example, but sequelize works fine with most relational databases
4. Create a `.env` file using the variables specified in the `.env.copy`
5. run the project using `$ npm start`
